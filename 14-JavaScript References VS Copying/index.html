    // ARRAYS //
    //

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team1 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];

    // or use Array.from()
    const team4 = Array.from(players);
    console.clear();

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    //
    // OBJECTS //
    //

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Abc Def',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',

      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    console.log(wes);

    //const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); // This will copy name and age, but only make reference to social

    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
